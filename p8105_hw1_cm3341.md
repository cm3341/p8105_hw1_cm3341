Load tidyverse for its functions, tidy syntax and operators, tibbles,
and because it includes ggplot2.

``` r
library(tidyverse)
```

## Problem 1

Load the `penguins` dataset and obtain the summary values using the
`summarise` function.

``` r
data("penguins", package = "palmerpenguins")

dataset_size = penguins %>%
  summarise(
    rows = nrow(penguins), 
    columns = ncol(penguins)
    )

mean_flipper_length = penguins %>%
  summarise(
    mean_flipper_length_mm = mean(
      flipper_length_mm, na.rm = TRUE)
    )
```

\*The `penguins` dataset includes bill measurements, flipper
measurements, body mass in grams, sex, the year of measurement, and the
corresponding island for three different species of penguin: Adelie,
Chinstrap, and Gentoo.

\*The data set has 8 columns and 344 rows.

\*The mean flipper length is 200.9152047 mm.

**Scatterplot of flipper length vs. bill length**

``` r
ggplot(
  penguins, aes(
    x = bill_length_mm, 
    y = flipper_length_mm, 
    color = species)) +
  geom_point() +
  labs(
    title = "Flipper Length vs Bill Length", 
    x = "Bill Length (mm)", 
    y = "Flipper Length (mm)") +
  theme_minimal()
```

``` r
ggsave("flipper_vs_bill_length.png")
```

## Problem 2

Setting a seed for sampling consistency and reproducibility. Otherwise,
I’d get different entries in the dataframe every time I run the code.

``` r
set.seed(123)
```

Create the dataframe comprised of a random sample, a logical vector
indicating whether the elements of the sample are greater than 0, a
character vector of length 10, and a logical vector with three levels.

``` r
example_data = data.frame(
  norm_samp = rnorm(10),
  norm_samp_pos = rnorm(10) > 0,
  char_vector = letters[1:10],
  factor_vector = factor(sample(c("fun level", "ugly level", "evil level"), 10, replace = TRUE))
)

head(example_data)
```

    ##     norm_samp norm_samp_pos char_vector factor_vector
    ## 1 -0.56047565          TRUE           a    evil level
    ## 2 -0.23017749          TRUE           b    ugly level
    ## 3  1.55870831          TRUE           c     fun level
    ## 4  0.07050839          TRUE           d    evil level
    ## 5  0.12928774         FALSE           e     fun level
    ## 6  1.71506499          TRUE           f     fun level

Calculate the mean of each dataframe variable

``` r
mean_samp = mean(pull(example_data, norm_samp))
mean_samp_pos = mean(pull(example_data, norm_samp_pos))
mean_char = mean(pull(example_data, char_vector))
mean_vector = mean(pull(example_data, factor_vector))
```

\*The mean of the random sample is 0.0746256, which makes sense because
these are clearly numeric values.

The mean of the logical vector is 0.7, which is strange at first glance
because the entries in the logical vector look like characters. However,
R seems to treat, *TRUE* as a *1* and *FALSE* as a *0* and so it
calculates the mean based on the proportion of *TRUE* entries in the
vector.

\*The mean of the character vector is NA, which makes sense because one
cannot calculate the mean of a categorical variable.

\*The mean of the factor vector is NA, which makes sense because one
cannot calculate the mean of a categorical variable.

``` r
example_data[["norm_samp_pos"]] <- as.numeric(example_data[["norm_samp_pos"]])
example_data[["char_vector"]] <- as.numeric(example_data[["char_vector"]])
example_data[["factor_vector"]] <- as.numeric(example_data[["factor_vector"]])
```

When I convert the logical vector data to numeric data, the entries turn
into *1s and *0s\* which does make sense. It looks like logical data is
logged as binary and so that is why in the calculation of the mean for
logical data, there was an output of NA, though the entries in the
column looked like categorical data.

When I attempt to convert the character vector data into numeric data, I
receive an *NAs introduced by coercion* message. I see that the entries
in that column get turned into NAs. I would think that letters would
count as ordinal data, because the alphabet has an order to it, but I
guess R does not interpret letters as ordinal data and instead
interprets it as nominal data, without any intrinsic order to it. So the
`as.numeric` function can’t really turn it into anything numerical.

When I convert the factor vector data to numeric data, the entries turn
into *1s*, *2s*, and *3s*. R is picking up on the three levels that
exist in this vector and coding them with corresponding numbers. The NA
output when I tried to calculate the mean of the factor vector makes
sense because the mean of categorical data as levels doesn’t really mean
anything.
